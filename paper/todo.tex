- discuss criteria for termination : either some form of hilbert metric between two iterates, or a primal-dual gap (or both)
- motivate more the correcting factors A_ki in the interpolation formula, and maybe use a cleaner / more mathematically rigorous (?) formula 
- correct warning in bibtex
- detail a bit more the dimension of the variables involved (dimension of u, v, etc).
- smooth a bit the barycenter section, add some comments/motivations.
- re-do fig 6 with less trivial example (rotate input measures, etc). See how to improve display 
- extension to non symmetric tensors
- introduce also a relaxation parameter tau for the v scaling of barycenters.
- insist more on extrapolation / tau selection 
- explain sparse sinkhorn and multiscale
- show figure with cross tranport between mixtures of 2 diracs, comparing ansiotropic vs isotropic (classical) OT. 
- application to anisotropic meshing  (e.g. Labelle/Shewchuk method), see http://www.insight-journal.org/browse/publication/956
- explicit formula for 2x2 and 3x3 tensor exp/log
