- classical versus Q-OT comparison

- Section 5.3 paragraph 2: \tau should be \rho. Also, the parameters values in figure 8 and the text disagree (0.5 and 0.05).

- contraint on trace : TODO.

- In Figure 7, maybe show the tensor field?  [Or if the red stuff is the tensor field, it's not too visible]

- I might recommend splitting sec 5.4 into multiple paragraphs.

- Figure 9 looks much nicer than the previous version!  Can we include a few more examples of the same thing on different textures?  Right now the paper contains only one example of each application, which may look suspicious to reviewers.
