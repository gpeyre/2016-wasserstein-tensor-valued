\subsection{Anisotropic Meshing}

Approximation with anisotropic piecewise linear finite elements on a triangulated mesh is a fundamental tool to address tasks such as discretizing partial differential equations, performing surface remeshing~\cite{alliez2003anisotropic} or for image compression~\cite{demaret2006image}.
%
A common practice is to generate triangulation complying with a PSD tensor field $\mu$, i.e. such that a triangle centred at $x$ should be inscribed in the ellipsoid $\enscond{u}{(u-x)^\top \mu(x) (u-x) \leq \de }$ for some $\de$ controlling the triangulation density. 
%
A well known result is that optimal triangle shapes to locally approximate a smooth convex $C^2$ function $f$ is dictated by the Hessian $H f$ of the function~\cite{shewchuk2002good}, so that in practice people use $\mu(x) = |H f(x)|^\al$ for some exponent $\al > 0$ (which is related to the quality measure of the approximation).
%
Figure~\eqref{fig:meshing} shows that Q-OT can be used (using formula~\eqref{eq-interpolating}) to interpolate between two sizing fields $(\mu,\nu)$, which are computed from the Hessian of two initial input images $(f_0,f_1)$.
%
The resulting anisotropic triangulations are defined as geodesic Delaunay triangulation for the Riemannian metric defined by the tensor field, and computed using the method detailed in~\cite{peyre-iccv-09}
%
This interpolation could typically used to track the evolution of the solution of some PDE.
