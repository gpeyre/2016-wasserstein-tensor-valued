\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we have proposed a new static formulation for OT between tensor-valued measures. This formulation is an extension of the recently proposed unbalanced formulation of OT. A chief advantage of this formulation is that, once coupled with quantum entropic regularization, it leads to an effective numerical scheme, which is easily extended to the computation of barycenters.
