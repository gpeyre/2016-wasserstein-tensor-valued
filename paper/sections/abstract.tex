This article introduces a new notion of optimal transport (OT) between tensor fields, which are measures whose values are positive semidefinite matrices (PSD).
% 
This ``quantum'' formulation of OT corresponds to a relaxed version of the classical Kantorovich transport problem, where the fidelity between the input PSD-valued measures is captured using the geometry of the Von-Neumann quantum entropy.
%
We propose a quantum-entropic regularization of the resulting convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently using an iterative scaling algorithm. This method is a generalization of the celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm to the quantum setting of PSD matrices. 
% 
We extend this formulation and the quantum Sinkhorn algorithm to compute barycenters within a collection of input tensor fields. 
% 
% We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach on ....
