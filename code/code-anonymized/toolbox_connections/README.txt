Example Code for "Trivial Connections on Discrete Surfaces"
-----------------------------------------------------------
Keenan Crane
June 15, 2010

This program computes smooth direction fields on meshes using the method
described in Crane et al, "Trivial Connections on Discrete Surfaces."
The primary purpose of this code is to illustrate how the algorithm works;
it is likely not suitable for large meshes.  Furthermore, for simplicity,
this version of the code works only on genus-0 surfaces without boundary,
i.e., topological spheres.

You can test the code from the MATLAB command line by simply typing 'run'
from the install directory.  You should be presented with a plot that looks
like the one in test.png, exhibiting a single singularity of index +2 on
the sphere.

This code was developed for an introductory undergraduate course on discrete
differential geometry, and follows three prior assignments:

  Topological Invariants of Discrete Surfaces

  Mesh Smoothing

  Vector Field Decomposition

The material above builds all of the necessary concepts (both code and math)
from the ground up, and should provide a concrete understanding of most of
the ideas used in this code -- the remaining ideas are discussed in the paper
