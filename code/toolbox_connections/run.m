%
% This program computes smooth direction fields on meshes using the method
% described in Crane et al, "Trivial Connections on Discrete Surfaces."
% The primary purpose of this code is to illustrate how the algorithm works;
% it is likely not suitable for large meshes.  Furthermore, for simplicity,
% this version of the code works only on genus-0 surfaces without boundary,
% i.e., topological spheres.
%
% This script is the main routine, and should be called from the MATLAB
% command line by simply typing 'run'.  A mesh file can be specified by
% editing the lines under INPUT below.  Meshes should be in Wavefront OBJ
% format with ONLY lines of the form
%
%    v x y z
%
% or
%
%    f i1 i2 i3
%
% i.e., vertex coordinates or triangles (no comments, texture coordinates,
% etc.).  An example file can be found in 'test.obj'.
%
% Singularities are specified via (vertex ID, index) pairs (also under INPUT)
% where the vertex IDs should correspond to 1-based indices used in the
% corresponding OBJ file.  Indices are used to specify the behavior of
% singularities at these vertices, and must sum to 2, which is the Euler
% characteristic of a topological sphere.
%
% ----------
%
% This code was developed for an introductory undergraduate course on discrete
% differential geometry, and follows three prior assignments:
%
%   Topological Invariants of Discrete Surfaces
%   http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~keenan/ddg_exercises/ddg_hw1.pdf
%
%   Mesh Smoothing
%   http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~keenan/ddg_exercises/ddg_hw2.pdf
%
%   Vector Field Decomposition
%   http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~keenan/ddg_exercises/ddg_hw3.pdf
%
% The material above builds all of the necessary concepts (both code and math)
% from the ground up, and should provide a concrete understanding of most of
% the ideas used in this code -- the remaining ideas are discussed in the paper
